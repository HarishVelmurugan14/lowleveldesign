        // Way 1 : Create a class for each : but they are the same with modified characteristics
        // so having different classes extending human is pointless

        // Way 2 : Create a class for human, Maintain characteristics of each race by modifying human and have a db entry
        // once a new elf is needed fetch the human property append the elf properties and then return too much hassle

        // Proper way : Instead of fetching db every time register human properties, elf properties and
        // others once in registry and fetch as many times as we need
        // Kind of caching :  fetch from db and save in registry for repeated usages

        // NOTE : INTERVIEW EXPLANATION
        // The Registry Pattern here acts like a central dictionary that stores character instances by type.
        // Whenever the game needs a character (Human, Elf, or Orc), it looks it up from the registry instead of manually creating it.
        // This helps if new characters are added later â€” just register them once, and any part of the game can access them by name.

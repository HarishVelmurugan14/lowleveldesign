Is XmlToJsonAdapter a Facade if it also emails, logs, and saves to DB?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Short Answer:
No — it is still an Adapter.

Reason:
As long as the class’s main purpose is to make an XML-based library behave like a JSON provider,
it remains an Adapter, regardless of how many extra side tasks it performs.

Key Rule:
- Adapter = Convert one interface to another (XML → JSON).
- Facade = Simplify multiple subsystems behind one easy method.

In your case:
- The method is still getJson()
- The intent is still XML → JSON conversion
- Email/log/DB save are side effects, not the main responsibility

Therefore:
Even with extra work, it is still an Adapter, not a Facade.

When would it become a Facade?
Only if the class’s primary purpose was to simplify a complex workflow, like:

String processXml();

And inside it called:
- XML parser
- Email service
- Logging service
- Database service
- Notification service
- Conversion tools

Then the goal changes to “simplify subsystems,” which is a Facade.

How to detect the truth in ONE LINE

Ask this:

“Is the class meant to simplify a complex system OR to convert one interface into another?”

✔ If goal = convert XML → JSON → Adapter
✔ If goal = hide complexity of many services → Facade
